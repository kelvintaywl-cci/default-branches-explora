# Default branches Exploration

The goal of this sample repo (project on CircleCI) is to test the behaviours of the following features for [default branches](https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us/articles/15222074173723-How-to-allowlist-additional-branches-for-Only-Build-Pull-Requests):

- Auto-cancel redundant workflows
- Only build PRs

## Current default branches:

```console
$ echo TODO
```
